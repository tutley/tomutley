      <description>I am a big fan of decentralization. I believe that this is the best model for human interaction and it applies to so many things. Recently I discovered decentralized applications and now I&amp;rsquo;m trying to learn everything I can about them because I think they have tremendous potential.
What is decentralization? When I talk about decentralization, I&amp;rsquo;m referring to taking decision making power and authority from one central source, or collection of sources, and spreading it out to much smaller and less powerful units, eventually spreading all the way out to the individual.</description>
